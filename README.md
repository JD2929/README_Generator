# Professional README Generator

## Description

The README Generator, generated a README.md file using the answers the user gives to a set of questions. Users have the opportunity to choose 1 of 4 licenses to have on their project.

## User Story

"AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project" 

This is a very specific user story and that is why I have included it here in the README. It is not a general-use type of program that the everyday computer user would need or be looking for. 

## Credits

Licenses have been used from the websites provided to us by the course. Such as https://opensource.org/licenses/. Thanks to the assistant instructor Mark Alfano for sharing the links.

## Screenshots

I have included more screenshots than usual for homework assignments as there is no deployed page to refer to.
